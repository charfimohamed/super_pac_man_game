## ❄ ADVANCED TECHNIQUES ❄
> When moving your player you are giving a direction to him and this direction will effectively take place only when possible. Be aware when moving near the fire because it is a walkable cell and it will decrease 1 hp.

> * The main goal of the game is to pass through all levels and to gain the maximum score.
> * **Cherry (+200 points):** Increases your score by 200 points.
> * **Diamond (+10 points):** Increases your score by 10 points.
> * **Heart (+1 HP):** Increases your HP by 1 point (your max HP is 5).
> * **Fire (-1 HP, Respawn):**  Passing through fire results in death, respawn, and a decrease of 1 HP.
> * **Coin (Super Power, 10 seconds):** Grants a 10-second superpower that allows you to eat ghosts. Your speed increases, and each ghost eaten awards 500 points (beware of fire; it will always kill you).
